## Some Context

I have been using the pandas library for almost 2 years now, but I have always been interested in getting started with using PySpark in a big data project. Since I intend to build a daily habit of taking notes of what I've learnt (which I haven't really been keeping up since I end up feeling pressured to write some perfect long post whenever I start writing), I have decided to start off by writing down some notes on PySpark while I follow through the courses on Datacamp and Dataquest.
